Description:

This project demonstrates the implementation of an AI-based recommendation system using Java and Apache Mahout, a scalable machine learning library. The core objective of this system is to suggest relevant products or content to users based on their past preferences, thereby enhancing user experience and personalization.

The system employs a User-Based Collaborative Filtering algorithm, which is one of the most widely used techniques in artificial intelligence for recommender systems. It analyzes the preferences of a group of users and recommends items to a specific user based on the similarity of their preferences with others. For example, if two users have similar tastes, the system recommends items liked by one user to the other.

The recommendation model is trained using user-item rating data, where users rate certain items (products, movies, articles, etc.). The system uses Pearson Correlation Similarity to find users with similar taste profiles and suggests new items accordingly.

Tools & Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Java

Machine Learning Library: Apache Mahout (version 0.9)

Build System: Apache Maven

Logging Library: SLF4J with slf4j-simple binding

Editor/IDE: IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition

Data Format: CSV (Comma-Separated Values) for training data

Algorithm Used: User-Based Collaborative Filtering using Nearest Neighbors and Pearson Similarity

Project Structure:

src/main/java: Contains Java source files including the RecommendationEngine.java class.

src/main/resources: Holds the dataset file (data.csv) containing user-item preferences.

pom.xml: Maven build file used to manage dependencies such as Mahout and SLF4J.

How It Works:

User preference data is loaded from a CSV file.

Apache Mahout builds a data model based on these preferences.

The system computes similarity between users using Pearson correlation.

The nearest neighbors are identified for a given user.

Based on neighborsâ€™ preferences, the system generates product recommendations.

Applications:

This AI-based recommendation system can be adapted for a wide range of real-world applications including:

E-commerce platforms: Recommending products based on purchase or browsing history

Streaming services: Suggesting movies, TV shows, or music

News apps: Recommending articles based on reading history

Educational platforms: Suggesting courses or learning materials

Retail: Personalized marketing and upselling

It serves as a foundational model that can be extended with item-based filtering, hybrid filtering, or deep learning techniques for more advanced use cases.

Conclusion:

This project is a practical demonstration of artificial intelligence applied to personalization and recommendation. It showcases the power of collaborative filtering in enhancing user satisfaction and engagement, and it introduces students and developers to real-world machine learning techniques using Java. The implementation is simple yet effective, making it a great entry point into AI-based product recommendation systems.
